# Fix Summary: "Failed to load news" Error

## Problem
The application was showing a "Failed to load news" error during testing.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Port Configuration Mismatch**: 
   - Backend was configured to run on port 3000 (default in server.js)
   - Frontend files were configured to connect to port 3001
   - This mismatch prevented the frontend from communicating with the backend

2. **Missing Environment Configuration**:
   - No [.env](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/backend/.env) file existed in the backend directory
   - The server was using default port 3000 instead of the intended port 3001

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Backend Configuration
- Created a proper [.env](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/backend/.env) file in the backend directory by copying [.env.backup](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/backend/.env.backup)
- The [.env](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/backend/.env) file correctly sets `PORT=3001`

### 2. Verified Frontend Configuration
- Confirmed that all frontend files already had the correct API base URL:
  - [script.js](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/frontend/script.js): `API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3001'`
  - [news.html](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/frontend/news.html): `const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'`
  - [auth.js](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/frontend/auth.js): `API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3001'`
  - [favorites.js](file:///d:/ai-news-aggregator/frontend/favorites.js): `API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:3001'`

### 3. Verified CORS Configuration
- Confirmed that the backend CORS settings allow requests from the frontend origin (http://localhost:8080)

## Testing Results
✅ **Backend is running correctly on port 3001**
✅ **Frontend can successfully connect to backend**
✅ **News articles are being loaded (50 articles confirmed)**
✅ **CORS is properly configured**

## Verification Commands Run
1. Created and ran test scripts to verify API URLs
2. Tested direct backend access via fetch requests
3. Verified CORS configuration
4. Confirmed successful news loading with actual article data

## Current Status
The "Failed to load news" error has been **RESOLVED**. The application should now work correctly with:
- Backend running on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend served on http://localhost:8080
- Proper communication between frontend and backend
- Successful news article loading
